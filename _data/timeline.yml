  description: >-
    A master program oriented towards understanding computer systems and networks. 
    I have decided to orient most of the eight elective courses towards cyber security 
    (there are a total of twelve courses in the program). This by taking all 
    the courses mentioned in the <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/master/secspec/">Security Specialization</a>. 
    My goal is to do a master's thesis in Cyber Security and then pursue a career in the field.
